# Agent Instructions

- Always read `PROGRESS.md` to understand current status and planned next steps before making changes.
- After completing work, update `PROGRESS.md` with current progress and potential next steps.
- Use test-driven development: write or update tests before implementing code and ensure they fail, then make them pass.
- Run linting and formatting with `--fix` or `-w` before committing and resolve any remaining issues manually.
